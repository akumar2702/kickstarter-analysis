# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

#### This project was built to test the skills and knowledge that I received in learning more functions about Excel. There are many formulas that can be used in real life situations and will be very helpful in making work easier. Learning these main functions in Excel will help in learning VBA and will lead to one becoming an expert with more practice. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### In this data, one can see that the most releases were in May and June. This shows that more people prefer to watch a play during the summer time. The month of May had the most successful and the most relases as well.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### In this data, one can see that the most sucessful projects are the ones with lower expectation goals. The most projects released were the ones with a goal of 1000 to 4999. The most failed are the ones with higher goals, such as 45,000 to 49,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Some challenges that I encountered was making sure the formulas are correct. If there is even one little mistype, that could mess up the whole data sheet and give you the wrong results. I didn't add one equal sign to the formula and it gave me a whole different chart than I wanted. In formulas, perfection is necessary to get the correct results.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

#### Two conclusions that I can draw based on the data are that the summer time has the most releases while winter has the least. The month of May had the most while December had the least releases.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

#### Based on the data, I can conclude that the higher goal expectancy, the less projects are released.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

#### Some limitations of this dataset are that this only includes plays, while there are so many more forms of theater. We could use other data from the main Kickstarter sheet and create more charts to compare other categories and the parent categories as well.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

#### We could create a pie chart, bar graph or box and whisker plot to compare all of the different data that we have.
